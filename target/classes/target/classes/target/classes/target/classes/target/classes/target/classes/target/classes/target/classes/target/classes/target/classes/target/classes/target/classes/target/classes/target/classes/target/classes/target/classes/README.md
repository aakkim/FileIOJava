# FileIOJava

As we start to use our programs to analyze more and more information, having a way to import and export information becomes critical. 
This is where file input and output become important. In this tutorial, we are going to look at a few things. 
First, we are going to take a look at how we read in lines from a file. 
We will then look at some very basic string manipulation to split our lines. Finally, we will look at how we can write out results to a file.
